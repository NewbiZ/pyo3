`impl FromPyObject for Vec<T>` will accept any Python object that can be turned into an iterator via Python's built-in `iter` function. It will also not reject `str` anymore which can be iterated as a sequence of `str` objects, i.e. [#2500](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/2500) was reverted. Please use a type like

```rust
#[derive(FromPyObject)]
pub enum OneOrMany<'py> {
    One(&'py PyString),
    Many(Vec<&'py PyString>),
}
```

if you would like to work around this edge case for callers of your API.
